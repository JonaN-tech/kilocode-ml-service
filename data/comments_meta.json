It lets you write plain-English prompts and turns them into real code, then refactors and debugs as you test. Inside Kilo Code you can select Claude Sonnet, GPT-4.1/Deepseek R1 0528 etc..with a single click. \nSince you’re a newbie, the $20 in free credits you get on sign-up give you plenty of runway to build a few small apps before spending anything.",
